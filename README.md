Project Overview
----------------



Installing
----------

Before building the program the user will need to install the SDL, SDL\_image, and SDL\_mixer libraries. Apart from that, all that should be necessary is a C++ compiler. 

The user runs 'make' to build the program. It has been tested on both Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but should work on other platforms as well.
